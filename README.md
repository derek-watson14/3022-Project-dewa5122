### Topic: Predicting Football Tables Throughout the Season

This project aims to use regression and football statistics to predict where teams will finish the season.

Please see `part3.ipynb` or `part3.pdf` for a full overview of the project. That is the final report from the project in two file formats.

Data and webscrapers are in the `data-retrieval` folder.
